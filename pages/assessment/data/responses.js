        less_than_4: `<b>Recommendations:</b><br><br><b>The Business Case</b><br>According to the <a href="https://www.gettingtalentbacktowork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-GTBTW_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)</a>, employees with past convictions are likely to have longer tenure, perform their job the same or better than workers without a criminal record, and are just as dependable or more dependable than their counterparts without convictions. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of HR Professionals surveyed state they are willing to work with individuals with past convictions. Make sure that you are following all applicable <a href="https://prisonerswithchildren.org/ban-the-box/" target="_blank">Ban the Box</a> laws. According to the <a href="https://www.nelp.org/publication/ban-the-box-fair-chance-hiring-state-and-local-guide/" target="_blank">National Employment Law Project (NELP)</a>, a total of 37 states (including the District of Columbia) and 150 cities and counties adopted "Ban the Box" laws. When conducting background checks, it is crucial to avoid the stigma or bias of a candidate's conviction record. Employers should educate themselves to comply with the local, state, and federal fair-chance policies.<br>
        <b>Ban the Box</b><br>In November 2015, former President Obama endorsed Ban-the-Box by directing federal agencies to consider an applicant's conviction record post-initial hiring stages. In December 2019, the "Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019" passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Effect, effective December 2021. This law prohibits federal agencies and contractors from seeking an applicant's record until a conditional job offer. It is imperative to weigh the legal implications of fair chance hiring when recruiting candidates.<br>
        <b>Recruitment Tips</b><br>There are many methods to advertise job opportunities for candidates with past convictions. For Indeed, Linkedin, and Honest Jobs, select "fair chance employer" to selectively reach out to these candidates. Fair chance employers can advertise in community colleges, vocational training programs, or patterning with local Workforce Development agencies to locate many candidates eager to utilize their newly acquired skills.<br>`,
        equal_to_or_greater_than_4: `<b>Congratulations!</b><br>You are a fair chance hirer! Have you thought about telling other employers in your network about the success that you have had? Share on LinkedIn, attend your local Chamber of Commerce meeting, and discuss your hiring and recruitment practices. As a credible messenger, you have a lot of impact and influence with other employers! Hiring people with past convictions should not be your best-kept secret. Be proud of your accomplishments and tell others about them.<br>`

        less_than_4: `<b>Recommendations:</b><br>Starting a new job for anyone is difficult and nerve-wracking, and it may be exceptionally difficult for those returning to the workforce. People returning from incarceration are adjusting back into society and are becoming familiar with new norms, customs, and culture. With some support, these individuals will thrive! Furthermore, HR professionals believe the quality of hire of workers with past convictions is the same or better than workers without convictions. Undoubtedly hiring them is good for your place of business!<br>
        <b>Human-centered Language</b><br>As a fair chance employer, you should consider the use of inclusive and human-centered language to bring a sense of welcome and belonging to your workplace. One of the initial considerations you should consider as a fair chance hirer is the use of human-centered language. Inclusive language in the workplace is crucial for employees with former convictions to have a sense of welcome and belonging in the workplace. Dehumanizing labels to avoid include “criminal”, “prisoner”, “convict”, “felon”, and “inmate”. Even language that uses "ex" with words like "ex-convicts'' can still harm and stigmatize employees impacted by the justice system. <b>It is always best to use person-centered language when working with all employees, including employees with past convictions</b>.<br>
        <b>Onboarding Support</b><br>Onboarding is a time when new employees become welcomed into the new workplace and are provided with the tools they need to become successful in their new role. Onboarding is key because it helps with productivity, assimilation, and integration into a new environment. Purposeful onboarding can transform ideal candidates into top-performing employees.<br>
        Communication, flexibility, and transparency are important in the onboarding process as many employees with past convictions may require occasional accommodations such as checking in with a probation or parole officer. Provide these reasonable accommodations as you would to any employee that has an extenuating circumstance. Rest assured these individuals will be so thankful, as would any employee, if their employer is willing to provide them with the support they need to be successful at not only employment but also navigating through life circumstances.<br>
        <b>Ideas to welcome employees and make them feel comfortable include a welcome letter, a packet for new hire paperwork, technology setup instructions, a company notebook, a company t-shirt, an office map, the first-week schedule, and any employee support groups. It is also recommended that during the employee's first 3 months, there should be regularly scheduled 1:1 meetings for check-ins to see how the new employee is adjusting to the new work environment and to evaluate if any accommodations may be needed.</b> This will ensure new employees are aware of support and expectations and will give them a sense of being part of the team.<br>

        <b>Feedback culture</b><br>Have you thought about eliciting feedback from your current workplace to explore additional ways you can transform your onboarding experience to be even more effective? Those with direct and lived experience may have feedback that would be impactful to your company's operations. Not only will this help the development of onboarding, but it also signals to them that their opinion and experiences matter!<br>

        less_than_4: `<b>Recommendations:</b><br><br><b>Tenure</b><br>A study of 1.3 million military enlistees found that enlistees with past convictions had superior performance compared to those with no convictions. What does this mean for you as an employer? As an employer, it is important to understand and give opportunities for these skilled and talented individuals who can grow within your company. As with any employee, making specific investments in talent development has big dividends.<br>
        <b>Growth and Mobility</b><br>One of the most important aspects of employee growth is to learn about their goals and aspirations. In addition to formal talent development opportunities via training and other offerings, having routine conversations through one-on-one meetings about professional development may increase employee engagement, success, and retention, building a crucial foundation for high performance.<br>
        <b>Investment</b><br>A practical way to help employees grow is by providing job shadowing opportunities. After you learn more about your employee's interests, purposefully set up opportunities for your employees to experience roles that mirror their passion. You have the opportunity to significantly impact someone's life by listening and creating opportunities. Investing in talent development positions employees for career advancement and can help your company advance its mission.<br>

        less_than_4: `<b>Recommendations:</b><br>Critical causes for high employee turnover include poor compensation, insufficient employee benefits, lack of career development opportunities, poor company culture, lack of recognition or rewards, and lack of connectivity with the company.<br>
        <b>Company Culture</b><br>Employees with past convictions desire a sense of security and a culture conducive to learning and growth. Employee retention starts at onboarding. All employees must be given adequate training and clearly understand expectations and norms. Recognizing employees that have contributed to the company can positively impact the company culture and thereby increase retention. <b>One way to do this is to provide bi-annual performance reviews linked to compensation increases. Employees with past convictions have usually experienced high stigmatization, so giving positive feedback and recognition goes a long way. Lastly, consider non-traditional benefits such as 0% interest loans to obtain life-stabilizing measures such as a deposit on an apartment or a vehicle</b> These benefits can significantly reduce barriers to employment and help your employee stay around for the long term.<br>

        equal_to_or_greater_than_4: `<b>Impressive!</b><br>Your workplace is a model for other companies seeking to improve their fair chance hiring practices. You have created a culture conducive to growth and development, and your employees want to work for your company.<br>
        <b>Use your power to do social good!</b><br>Have you considered ways to use your power as an employer to do social good? Because of your status in the community, you can encourage other employers in your network to hire job seekers with past convictions and mitigate collateral consequences that impact people's ability to reintegrate or achieve successful economic mobility.<br>
        In your sector, are there specific regulations that unfairly ban people from employment due to required licensing? Talk to your elected officials and encourage them to oppose these harmful practices that often marginalize people with past convictions. Never underestimate your power to do good!<br>
