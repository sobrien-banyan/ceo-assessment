    <h3 class="underline decoration-solid font-bold">Fair Chance Hiring in Action</h3><br>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Case Study #1 - Employer Commitments</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">JP Morgan Chase (JPMC) actively recruits job seekers with prior criminal convictions by engaging with a network of
        community-based partners that support the reentry community. JPMC’s “ban-the-box” philosophy is that all candidates
        for employment are evaluated on their skills and abilities to perform the required job function. Hiring managers are
        not made aware that an applicant may have a prior conviction. Background checks are only conducted after the job
        candidate receives a conditional offer of employment. Should a conviction be uncovered, candidates are offered the
        opportunity to provide evidence of rehabilitation or contest inaccuracies. Results are reviewed on a case-by-case
        basis, with a commitment to privacy and confidentiality.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">JPMC is also using their power to do social good by funding legal services for job seekers who are currently
        disqualified for employment in the financial services industry due to a past criminal record. With this support,
        jobseekers may qualify for record-sealing or federal programming that makes them eligible for employment at JPMC and
        other financial institutions</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">JPMC’s fair chance hiring initiative has led to <span class="font-bold">10% of new hires annually at JPMC</span>
        having previous convictions, with no influence on their role or status within the company.</p>

    <h3 class="font-bold">Case Study #2 - Supportive Employer Culture</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">Justine was an experienced executive level manager determined to rehabilitate. After serving seven years for
        embezzlement, she returned home with a bag of ill-fitting clothes from a local nonprofit. She lost everything during
        incarceration.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">Justine quickly secured two part-time jobs and adjusted to being a line-cook with local restaurants. She was
        transparent about her situation with the General Manager, and the management team was supportive. Justine
        successfully navigated the process of reentry while working, including finding transportation and securing her own
        apartment.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">The manager recognized many transferable skills that Justine learned while incarcerated which helped Justine move
        into roles with more responsibility Now, Justine is the General Manager and is able to“pay-it-forward” by
        implementing fair chance hiring practices for the restaurant teams she manages.</p>
